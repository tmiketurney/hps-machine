cvs tag "PartStamper-StateProblem"

Need to re-evaluate project at this point:

1) Log file is not as helpful as expected
    a) Ascii strings instead of enum
    b) __FILE__ and __LINE__ need to come from caller
    c) too much stuff

2) State Machine testing has uncovered problems
   with I/O task and command message semantics

3) msg_receive should be IPC_WAIT

4) verify no memory leak

5) diagram SW

6) Conditional Compile Log


Tools to use, explore:
    a) cbrowser
    b) cscope
    c) dmalloc
    d) ???

Power of the Delta Approach to Design
=====================================

Design  Top-Down
        Out-In

Do basic design up to logical point A.
This logical point must have quantifiable objectives, e.g.
    Build Project Infrastructure
    Define Process-Level modules
    Define Process Interfaces
    Build "soft" I/O layer with "Perfect" simulator
    Build Tcl test harness

STOP, take a breath, learn the lessons.

Fix the problems discovered doing Logical Point A

Do basic design up to logical point B.
